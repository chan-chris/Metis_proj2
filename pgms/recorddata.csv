From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

Dizzy Gillespie – Concert In Paris,Royal Roost – ROOST LP 2214,US,"Vinyl, LP, Album","Recorded at the Salle Pleyel, Paris,February, 1953.

Timing listed on the rear cover for the first track is incorrect and is actually 6:15 (including a 1:10 introduction by a local French M/C). Timing for the last track is not given on the rear cover - what's listed is a measured duration.

Text on back cover:

When the French ""Jazzbeau' introduces these sides, his announcement of the principal artist is merely...""Et"" -- Dizzy!"" At that, the applause is spontaneous and warm.

Unquestionably Dizzy's prominence abroad as well as in America is phenomenal, therefore it is natural that Roost should add another great album to those already illustrating his European endeavors. This is the reason for the release of the exciting ""CONCERT IN PARIS"" sides. The album is a happy choice of French atmosphere due to the bits of dialogue included and music that swings via Dizzy.

With his own unit around him, Dizzy moves through a colorful combination of themes. Especially good is ""My Man"" with a nice backing for Dizzy by Wade Legge on piano. Bill Graham does some fine phrasing behind trumpet on ""Good Bait."" The most fun of all, though, is ""I've Got the Bluest Blues"" with everybody getting in their special 'licks'. Joe Caroll does some singing on this one and the entire thing swings. Caroll also sings with Dizzy on ""The Champ"" and it's a successful venture.

Dizzy controls the entire nine sides but it must be noted that the contrapuntal methods he is known for are still at work here with Wade Legge, and more particularly, Bill Graham supplying the major part. The group, other than Joe Carroll as vocalist, consists of Lou Hackney on 'Contra Bass' as indicated in the French introduction, and Al Jones on drums.

Naturally the success of any one musician in a small combo depends largely on the muscians he surrounds himself with and for someone as thorough-going in musicianship at Dizzy Gillespie is, it is naturally more important. All of the musicians in his group are young and because of this, easily adaptable to new ideas and they themselves generate a certain original genius. It's a compact and harmonious group. As is audible from the records they are well-received by audiences not only for their talent but for their amiability on the stand as well. Dizzy of course, is a fine showman and Joe Carroll and Bill Graham complement his personality.

These sides will gall among the jazz collector's items of our times for they are part of the musical chronology of possibly the greatest imaginative figure in the 'Bop' era. No single musician has ever had more adulation than Dizzy. No other jazz musician has experienced more world-wide acclaim. No other musician could ever 'get away' with what Dizzy has managed to happily 'get away' with on the stand. No other trumpeter in the progressive jazz idiom can claim sole priority over his 'progressive' ideas for almost invariably they are attributable and are a tribute to the creator of the sounds on trumpet with which we are familiar today. The impact of his figure on the jazz world is such that he almost a myth in musicology. The Beret. The Goatee, The Thick-Rimmed Glasses. The Scatting. The Bop Talk. They all manifest a personality -- and they manifest a beginning of an era. But the important thing about all this is that Dizzy, like Bird, and Max, and the Pres, and Bud, still is creating and still retaining a highly personal and therefore, highly original music.",Jazz,1957,"Bop, Afro-Cuban Jazz","Rated 4.20 of 5 votes (105 have, 34 want)",Near Mint (NM or M-),Sleeve: Near Mint (NM or M-),99.6%,nan,nan,$100.00

According to Wikipedia:

The album features performances by Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Joe Newman, Phil Woods, Joe Henderson, Jim Hall, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette. Although Jimmy Smith is credited with playing organ on the album some sources claim it was Paul Griffin that was present at the recording sessions.

The album also includes ""Stroll On"", a rewrite of Tiny Bradshaw's ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"", by the Yardbirds featuring Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. The liner notes to a 2000s CD release indicate that Hancock first recorded his score in London with British musicians, but rejected the results and re-recorded the music in New York with American jazz musicians. The bassline to ""Bring Down the Birds"" was sampled by Deee-Lite for their 1990 single ""Groove is in the Heart.""[3]

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

It is unfirling in lunch counters, buses, libraries and schools - wherever the dignity and potential of men are denied. Youth and idealism are unfurling.

What this album is saying is that FREEDOM DAY is coming in many places, and those working for it mean to make it stick. In 1937, a Negro who still remembered slavery spoke of what it was like in 1865. ""Hallelujah broke out... Everyboby went wild. We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

According to Wikipedia:

The album features performances by Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Joe Newman, Phil Woods, Joe Henderson, Jim Hall, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette. Although Jimmy Smith is credited with playing organ on the album some sources claim it was Paul Griffin that was present at the recording sessions.

The album also includes ""Stroll On"", a rewrite of Tiny Bradshaw's ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"", by the Yardbirds featuring Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. The liner notes to a 2000s CD release indicate that Hancock first recorded his score in London with British musicians, but rejected the results and re-recorded the music in New York with American jazz musicians. The bassline to ""Bring Down the Birds"" was sampled by Deee-Lite for their 1990 single ""Groove is in the Heart.""[3]

From the liner notes: ""This record was produced during the early part of 1964, when Eric Dolphy and producer Alan Douglas decided to experiment with Eric's original compositions.
Two approaches were agreed upon. One was of clear simplicity; Eric on reed instruments and Richard Davis on bass. The other was more involved - a ten piece orchestra of young men who understood and admired Eric's work.
The recording sessions took place late at night in a very relaxed studio for five successive nights. In this environment the playing of Eric Dolphy, Richard Davis and the other musicians was unbelievably inspired. So much was created, individual compositions went from 'almost commercial' to 'very far out.'
Two albums were produced from that beautiful week. The first, called 'Conversations,' was released through FM Records (now available through the Roulette Record catalogue). On this, the second, is incorporated performances that were considered too futuristic to put out at that time.""",Jazz,1968,Free Jazz,"Rated 5.00 of 2 votes (36 have, 95 want)",Near Mint (NM or M-),Sleeve: Near Mint (NM or M-),99.6%,nan,nan,$99.99

Front cover: Circular cut-out in sleeve, revealing rotating 'clockwork image' card insert- through which the band members can be viewed on a further inserted full-color backing sheet.

Inside:
Uncensored image of nude girl (A bikini was used to censor a US version of this album, cat suffix 'X'). Non-gatefold issues also exist.
The words ""...Kevin Ayres of Berne Bay,..."" are wrongly attributed to Kevin Ayers & Herne Bay in the text, as is a reference to Wyatt's mentor - George Neidorf - as ""Neidori"". Shaw, in the idiosyncratic sleeve notes, continually refers to the band as ""The"" Soft Machine.

First cat.nr. on spine and cover, second on label.

On the spine the caption ''Command/Probe'' appears, on the label it's ''Command/ABC Records/Probe.''

From the liner notes: ""This record was produced during the early part of 1964, when Eric Dolphy and producer Alan Douglas decided to experiment with Eric's original compositions.
Two approaches were agreed upon. One was of clear simplicity; Eric on reed instruments and Richard Davis on bass. The other was more involved - a ten piece orchestra of young men who understood and admired Eric's work.
The recording sessions took place late at night in a very relaxed studio for five successive nights. In this environment the playing of Eric Dolphy, Richard Davis and the other musicians was unbelievably inspired. So much was created, individual compositions went from 'almost commercial' to 'very far out.'
Two albums were produced from that beautiful week. The first, called 'Conversations,' was released through FM Records (now available through the Roulette Record catalogue). On this, the second, is incorporated performances that were considered too futuristic to put out at that time.""",Jazz,1968,Free Jazz,"Rated 4.58 of 31 votes (160 have, 306 want)",Very Good Plus (VG+),Sleeve: Very Good Plus (VG+),100.0%,nan,Monarch Record Mfg.

The trio recorded 1 March and the sextet 29 March 1969. Both sessions were held in Herrick Shapel Lounge, Occidental College, Pete Welding and J.W. Hardy recording engineers. Robert McLeod, Artisan Sound Recorders, 1710 N. LaBrea, Hollywood, performed the dub-down from 4-track Scully recordings to the master tapes, and produced the master disc. Artisan features a new generation of recording equipment including the truly revolutionary Neumann VMS-66 lathe with SX-68 cutting head (see I told you it would be technical). The darned thing gives cleaner sound, lower distortion and more of what you want on a 12 inch disc in quality of reproduction than any other rig. It might seem strange to find such engineering quality on such a fly-by-night label ... but relax and enjoy it. Photos by J.W. Hardy, who also conceived of the album.

The Capitol Transcription Service - a division of Capitol Records - was the latecomer to ET industry in 1946, advertising a basic library of 2,000 selections with an additional 70 new ones every month.  With its roster of popular artists, Capitol soon attracted 300 subscribers. (10)  But as one record company was getting into the business, another was preparing to leave it.  

Capitol Records initially was associated with the MacGregor transcription company but started its own Capitol Transcription Service in 1945, which lasted to about 1953. Its 16 inch records were intended just for radio airplay, and were leased to subscribing radio stations. Originally these records were to be destroyed after a specific play date, but after the war, the idea changed to creating permanent musical libaries for the participating stations.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

Andrzej Kurylewicz – Polish Radio Big Band,Polskie Nagrania Muza – XL 0241,Poland,"Vinyl, LP, Album, Russian Labels","Recorded in Warsaw, November 1964.
Made in Poland.

Omówienie tej płyty jest dla mnie przyjemnością ale też i pewnym kłopotem, gdyż w Polsce prawie nie istnieje tradycja orkiestr par excellence jazzowych. Trzeba przyznać, że dopiero Andrzej Kurylewicz pierwszy powołał do życia orkiestrę jazzową dużego formaty. Stało się to w roku 1964: właśnie minęło dziesięć lat od momentu, kiedy ""Kuryl"" rozpoczął w Krakowie karierę jazzmana. Jako pianista jazzowy, a potem trębacz znalazł się w czołówce weteranów polskiego jazzu, dał się też poznać i poza krajem: w Wiedniu, Stuttgarcie, Francji, NRD, NRF, Danii, Bułgarii i Jugosławii. W 1964r. objął big band Radia warszawskiego, już jako leader-aranżer-puzonista. Rozpoczął od reorganizacji orkiestry wprowadzając doń solistów o ustalonej renomie jazzowej. Pierwszy publiczny występ w Filharmonii Narodowej w Warszawie utwierdził go w przekonaniu, że znalazł wreszcie poszukiwany od lat ""instrument"" orkiestrę. Otoczył się aranżerami spośród czołówki kompozytorów jazzowych i rozpoczął z zespołem systematyczną pracę, przygotowując ambitny, ciekawy repertuar.
""Skokiem wzwyż"" - był VII Jazz Jamboree 64 w Warszawie. Big band uroczyście otworzył tę doroczną tradycyjną imprę, dając dosłownie ""koncert gry"" przed tysięczną rzeszą wybrednej, premierowej publiczności. Przyszłość orkiestry została ugruntowana.
Czy nad grą zespołu dominuje ""myśl zespołowa""? Inwencja leadera? A może sugestie muzyki Count Basie'go i Ellingtona? - takie pytania mogą się nasuwać w momencie gdy zaczynamy słuchać płyty.
W miarę narastania dźwięków znajdujemy klucz: w oparciu o wielkie wzory orkiestra wypracowała indywidualny styl i klimat.
Big band Polskiego Radia pod dyrekcją Andrzeja Kurylewicza wspaniale wykorzystuje zarówno modern jak i podstawowe elementy muzyki jazzowej: blues i swing.

1) Selector Junior - debiut aranżerski wybitnego pianisty W. Karolaka. Choć w kompozycji można dostrzec wpływy Bill Evans'a i Quincy Jones'a, to jednak mamy do czynienia z autentyczną osobowością kompozytora. Solowe partie należą do: Kacperskiego - puzon, Banasiaka - sax-tenor, Kurylewicz - puzon-went.

2) Guma - nastrojowa ballada w której występuje jak gdyby nakładanie się barw i łącznie faktur. Solówka należy do Kurylewicza (puzon) - instrument został jednak tak zmiksowany, aby nie zaciemniać walorów całej orkiestry, dzięki czemu brzmienie puzonu jest jakby zawoalowane, zbliżone do dźwięku rogu.

3) Kocur Naukowiec- nie tylko tytuł jest pocieszny - poczucie humoru kompozytora uzewnętrznia się w utworze pełnym lekkości, utrzymanym w konwencji nowoczesno-swingowej. Partie solowe wykonują: F. Kowalski - trąbka-tłumiona i częściowo Banasiak - sax-tenor.

4) Piasek - debiut aranżerski M. Urbaniaka (sax-tenor) - utwór przejrzysty w formie bluesa, dwie części przedzielone wstawką-dwugłosem orkiestry i perkusji. Solówka - Kurylewicz

5) Wszystko o Kowalskich - znów do głosu dochodzi Wróblewski - ""dowcipniś"", który utwór poświęcił nie tyle trębaczowi Kowalskiemu co całej armii ""polskich Kowalskich""

6) Sympatie i Antypatie - elegancki i zrównoważony utwór utrzymany jest w konwencji bopu, puzon + sax-tenor + flet prowadzą melodię uniesioną, a cały utwór jest właściwie popisem P. Figla - pianisty zespołu.

7) Byk - fragment 24-minutowego tryptyku baletowego, przygotowanego dla sławnego Teatru Pantomimy Wrocławskiej H. Tomaszewskiego. Nastrojowa Introdukcja ma miejscami ""polskie brzmienie"". W pierwszym fragmencie solistą jest trębacz Kowalski, w drugim - o lirycznym charakterze - melodię prowadzą puzony z sax-tenorami i na tym tle w solówce występują: Kurylewicz - tym razem na trąbce tłumionej, sax - tenor - Banasiak, najbardziej dynamiczny, o wzrastającym napięciu o kulminacji - Walter - Perkusja.

8) Ballada dla Anny - kompozycja pianisty (Piotr Figiel - przyp. red) zespołu, w której ciepły i serdeczny nastrój wytwarza się dzięki bardzo osobistemu stosunkowi do tematu zarówno kompozytora jak solisty (Banasiak).

9) Wieczorem po Marszałkowskiej - impresja pełna finezji, utrzymana w duchu nowoczesno-swingowym. Solówki: puzon - Kacperski i fortepian - Figiel.

10) Lisi Krok - ulubiona pozycja big bandu, skrzy się dowcipem, poczuciem humoru kompozytora. Solo: sax-tenor (Baniasiak). Jest to znakomita kropka nad ""i"" całej płyty.",Jazz,1965,Big Band,"Rated 5.00 of 2 votes (23 have, 59 want)",Very Good Plus (VG+),Sleeve: Very Good Plus (VG+),100.0%,nan,nan,$95.00

However, this is not what is referred to as the “Misprint” version. The “Misprint” format only applies to those issues where the Side 2 track listing is incorrect on the label and the sleeve as here Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue
It is true that this issue does have the Side 2 track listing error on the sleeve (or 'back cover' as described above) but this was still present on releases as late as 1977, e.g. PC 8163 Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue The key point is the misprint on the label.

Subtitled ""Improvisational mood music for modern dream extensions"".

First released in Italy as MLDS 20243 in 1966.

This 1967 edition was released simultaneously in the US and Canada with the same cover, and in both mono and stereo.
For the North American edition, the cover was completely redone. The name of the group and titles were changed to match the psychedelic cover image. The back shows new song titles for each piece, but here the original Italian titles are still readable next to them in a small font as are the credits for the performers. Most of the back cover is taken up an article written by David Horowitz on the expanding influence making of money from things that were plentiful and cheap before. It is hard to tell if he in the psychedelic scene not understanding why this European avant-garde music was being put out, of if really knew the music and was disgusted at RCA decided to market it.

Jacket marked ""Printed in U.S.A."" and label marked ""Made in U.S.A.""

This is the 2nd pressing with the 1st take of the piece.
By accident Bob Thiele put out the wrong take. After he went through the initial press run, he switched the masters to the other take and inscribed edition II on the inside of the runout circle. So there are really two versions of ascension.

The Electronic Concept Orchestra* – Moog Groove,"Limelight – LS-86070, Limelight – LS86070",US,"Vinyl, LP, Album","For years it seemed that no really new instrumental sounds were being discovered for the world of pop music (except perhaps the ""wa-wa"" pedal)—and then it happened. Within the past year electronic music has exploded upon the scene. After more than fifteen years of development and experimentation mostly in abstract avant-garde serious music, electronic music has finally been applied to songs that really set a groove.
This exciting development hasn't happened automatically. Only within the past several years have there been electronic music instruments that are compact enough to be used in a recording studio. At present, of the available instruments, the Moog Synthesizer is gaining the greatest use (in the background on the front cover). Developed by Robert Moog, it has been used for effects on rock records for quite a while. Now with the creation of the Electronic Concept Orchestra it becomes a pop instrument of amazing versatility. By electronically producing tones with an infinite variety of frequency characteristics, the ""Moog,"" through the technique of multi-track recording, can create a whole range of entirely new musical colors.
The Electronic Concept Orchestra was formed to create a musical approach to pop and rock music that is as fresh as Walter Carlos' efforts in the classical area with ""Switched On Bach."" Although many ""spaced-out"" effects can be created with electronic music, we have made an effort to put melody, music, and ""good vibes"" first and novelty gimmicks second. To that end, the efforts of Eddie Higgins as performer and arranger have been invaluable. Well known as a jazz pianist, Eddie has entered the world of electronic music with a real feeling for the fusion of the pop and electronic fields.
So here is the Electronic Concept Orchestra and its ""Moog Groove."" With thanks to The Beatles, Donovan, Joni Mitchell, Joe Cocker, Michel LeGrand and many others for bringing these great songs to our attention, we hope that you dig these sounds where you can feel it. Relax, loosen up, and get into the ""Moog Groove""! —R.M.

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
Sometimes magic happens in a recording studio. It happened on this album. From the moment that drummer, Morris Jennings, walked into the studio, set up his drums, and started to play, we all knew we were into something special. As a result, most of the instrumental backgrounds were ""one take"" affairs. A good performance, like good food, is fine, but that really exceptional performance (Just laying it down right) is like a gourmet meal—and Morris is a terrific ""cook""!","Electronic, Jazz, Pop",1969,"Synth-pop, Easy Listening","Rated 3.55 of 47 votes (694 have, 318 want)",Near Mint (NM or M-),Sleeve: Near Mint (NM or M-),98.8%,Universal Recording Studio,nan,$83.00

6-eye labels.

The back cover lists ""Flamenco Sketches"" as the fourth track and ""All Blues"" as the last track, which is incorrect. However, the labels list the tracks in the correct order, which is reflected in the tracklist on this page.

This version can be differentiated from the other 1959 stereo pressings by the labels:
First, there is misprinted version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with an error in the track order on the side B label.
Second, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with ""Kind Of Blue"" printed on one line on the side B label.
Third, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with slightly different typesetting that is most distinguishable in the width of the characters that form the catalog number and ""Stereo Fidelity"" at the top of the labels.

There is also a repress (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with labels that show ""CBS"" (CBS) in the upper center area, but are otherwise very similar to the Columbia '6-eye' labels on this version.
