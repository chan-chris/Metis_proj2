Serge Gainsbourg – N°4,Philips – B 76.553 R,France,"Vinyl, 10"", Album","Un visage très pâle que la lumière crue du projecteur rend presque blafard; des oreilles colorées comme par un jour de grand froid; un regard ironique mal caché par les paupières lourdes; un demi-sourire pincé; des mains qui se tordent et se crispent, à peine visibles dans la zone d'ombre; ainsi, devant les spectateurs de «La Tête de l'Art», se présente l'étonnant Serge GAINSBOURG.
Curieux, narquois, diabolique, ses chansons ne sont pas passionnées, intelligentes et froides plutôt. Pas de fleurs ni de mélodrame. Il est misogyne, ne crois pas à l'amour d'une femme; des déceptions nombreuses qu'il chante sans révolte et sans colère. De là son cynisme, pas celui du Don Juan blessé, mais celui du désabusé qui, n'ayant pour séduire ni le charme ni l'argent, rend durement les coups reçus. Cynisme donc. Pourtant en grattant un peu, on trouve souvent la tendresse chez Gainsbourg. Une tendresse pudique, qui se cache. Et cependant, il n'accepte pas de paraître tendre, il veut inquiéter. Plus qu'inquiétant, il est inquiet, tourmenté: un romantique moderne, amoureux du jazz et de l'humour noir mais qui finira un jour par chanter l'amour fou. L'heure de Gainsbourg viendra, je la crois proche.

The Braz Gonsalves 7 with Pam Crain – Raga Rock,Odeon – S/EMOE 101,India,"Vinyl, 7"", 45 RPM, EP","Notes on back sleeve -

BRAZ GONSALVES

It's all very well to blow the sax and churn out decades-old pop-numbers in smoke-filled security of restaurants and night clubs and it's quite another, Braz-style, to explore the nuances of Indian raga on his tenor sax. ""Raga Rock"" is an experiment and an invocation based on the Todi Rags. Braz likes to do things differently - he does his thing with two saxes - the alto and the tenor -in ""Down the Rock Bay...""

PAM CRAIN

Tossing her blonde curls with abandon. Pam has the enviable knack of putting old wine in brand new bottles and churning it out like vintage - a pop song or ballad becomes recreated with her original rendering. As much at home with rocks as with slow time, Pam gives it plenty of oomph in ""No amount of Loving"". And no amount of verbiage can do justice to her charm and verve.

The Original Pressing of this album is not on Discogs. The original had the “West 63rd NY 23” labels. The original pressing photos are if a second pressing not unlike this but are non the less incorrect. Any pressing of this with a simple (47 West 63rd) is a later pressing. This is a variant that I documented simply because the runout is different. Documenting all of the details will lead to Discogs being a more “complete” catalogue.

6-eye labels.

The back cover lists ""Flamenco Sketches"" as the fourth track and ""All Blues"" as the last track, which is incorrect. However, the labels list the tracks in the correct order, which is reflected in the tracklist on this page.

This version can be differentiated from the other 1959 stereo pressings by the labels:
First, there is misprinted version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with an error in the track order on the side B label.
Second, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with ""Kind Of Blue"" printed on one line on the side B label.
Third, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with slightly different typesetting that is most distinguishable in the width of the characters that form the catalog number and ""Stereo Fidelity"" at the top of the labels.

There is also a repress (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with labels that show ""CBS"" (CBS) in the upper center area, but are otherwise very similar to the Columbia '6-eye' labels on this version.

Probably a contractual obligation - it's a compilation of previously released instrumentals recorded by several Cook artists, but with Melody and another artist named Sam providing commentary. The album appears to have been compiled with the intent of producing a limbo dancing album, but it is much closer to easy listening. It's easy to assume this was done to suit the tourist market who would expect calypso to be more laid back.

Interestingly, this style of commentary is similar to the 'toasting' style that would be popular in Jamaican reggae.

Available in both Stereo and Mono. The Stereo version makes particularly inventive use of the stereo field, and is nothing like the 'vocals on left, instruments on right' standard of the time.","Jazz, Reggae, Latin, Folk, World, & Country",1963,Calypso,"Rated 2.50 of 2 votes (6 have, 41 want)",Very Good Plus (VG+),Sleeve: Very Good (VG),nan,nan,nan,$425.00

AN AWARD WINNING PERFORMANCE BY AN ALL-STAR JAZZ BAND... INTERSCORED IN THE SYMPHONY WITH TASTE AND SURPRISE IN TWO OF THE BEST KNOWN CLASSICAL WORKS
Borodin's Polovtsian Dances from the Prince Igor Suite... a symphonic tapestra of Oriental flavor brilliantly woven into a texture of superlative jazz.
Wagner's beautifully morose Overture to Tannhäuser... filled with driving jazz statements in sympathetic contrast to its original old world form.

The brilliant former hit record producer had simply, one day, thought to write and perform what he wrote. None too soon. His writing is so lyrically and musically compact . . . it says so very much in contemporary music , , , that it is deceptively and almost imperceptively coherent.

Lord Melody – Caribbean Limbo Music,Cook – 1280,Trinidad & Tobago,"Vinyl, Album, LP, Mono","Melody's last album for Cook Records. Cook info lists the recording date as 1962, but the release date as 1963, which means it may have been delayed.

Probably a contractual obligation - it's a compilation of previously released instrumentals recorded by several Cook artists, but with Melody and another artist named Sam providing commentary. The album appears to have been compiled with the intent of producing a limbo dancing album, but it is much closer to easy listening. It's easy to assume this was done to suit the tourist market who would expect calypso to be more laid back.

Interestingly, this style of commentary is similar to the 'toasting' style that would be popular in Jamaican reggae.

Available in both Stereo and Mono. The Stereo version makes particularly inventive use of the stereo field, and is nothing like the 'vocals on left, instruments on right' standard of the time.","Jazz, Reggae, Latin, Folk, World, & Country",1963,Calypso,"Rated 2.50 of 2 votes (6 have, 41 want)",Near Mint (NM or M-),Sleeve: Very Good (VG),100.0%,nan,nan,$350.00

Back Sleeve Liner Notes :
Serge Gainsbourg est un pianiste de vingt-cinq ans qui est devenu compositeur de chansons, parolier et chanteur. Il chante l'alcool, les filles, l'adultère, les voitures qui vont vite, la pauvreté, les métiers tristes. Ses chansons, inspirées par l'expérience d'une jeunesse que la vie n'a pas favorisé, ont un accent de mélancolie, d'amertume, et souvent la dureté d'un constat. Elles se chantent sur une musique un peu avare où, selon la mode de notre temps, le suivi du rythme efface la mélodie. Je souhaite à Serge Gainsbourg que la chance lui sourie autant qu'il le mérite et qu'elle mette dans ses chansons quelques taches de soleil.

Red Garland – All Kinds Of Weather,Prestige – 7148,US,"Vinyl, LP, Album, Mono, Deep groove","Recorded in November of 1958. Original first pressing has yellow fireworks labels with deep groove and ""RVG"" stamped in dead wax.

All Kinds Of Weather finds Red Garland heading up one of several late-fifties trio sessions at the Rudy Van Gelder studio in Hackensack, NJ. As always, the trio is formed by Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. By the time this album was released these three men were intimately acquainted with each other, having performed and recorded together on numerous occasions, and it shows. Using ‘the weather’ as a common theme, this exceptional trio seamlessly performs standards like George Gershwin’s “Summertime” (from Porgy & Bess), “Stormy Weather” (originally written for Cab Calloway), and the classic Christmas tune, “Winter Wonderland”. Just one in a string of memorable late-fifties sides by Garland for Prestige.

On the original version (this), jacket reads: Prestige 7148 under Red Garland on the front, spine and back.
Lower right corner of front cover reads: esmond edwards in small lowercase print.

...'Turiya' is a state of consciousness. It is regarded as the high state of Nirvana, the goal of human life...
...IHS means 'I Have Suffered'. It exemplifies the sufferings and tribulations of mankind in general. According to Eastern thought, suffering is a gift from God. Certain individuals suffer to a greater extent, more than others, depending upon Karma (action in general).

What this album is saying is that FREEDOM DAY is coming in many places, and those working for it mean to make it stick. In 1937, a Negro who still remembered slavery spoke of what it was like in 1865. ""Hallelujah broke out... Everyboby went wild. We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

Scott Fagan – South Atlantic Blues,ATCO Records – SD 33-267,US,"Vinyl, LP, Album","Scott Fagan’s debut album, ‘South Atlantic Blues,’ is a genuine lost classic — a mystical, mythical and deeply soulful masterpiece. Recorded when Scott was just 21, virtually homeless and with pennies to his name, it was released in 1968 on Atco Records but remained obscure, confounded by a series of frustrating near-misses.

Steeped in delicate psych, soul and resonant acoustic guitars “that stroke and stone you to the core” (Shindig). It’s an epic song cycle about Fagan’s hard-scrabble life in the Virgin Islands, where he was raised and lived until 19 before returning to his birthplace of New York City.

A teenage prodigy, mentored and managed by songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Scott recorded early material for Columbia and Bert Berns’ BANG label before signing with Atco.

In 1969, artist Jasper Johns discovered ‘South Atlantic Blues’ in a cut-out bin, fell in love with the record, and used it as the inspiration for three artworks, known as ‘Scott Fagan Record.’ The pieces are now housed in the permanent collections of MOMA, the Met and the Walker Art Center.","Jazz, Rock, Funk / Soul, Pop, Folk, World, & Country",1968,"Folk, Vocal, Folk Rock, Rhythm & Blues, Soul","Rated 4.00 of 20 votes (180 have, 202 want)",Mint (M),Sleeve: Mint (M),100.0%,nan,"Columbia Records Pressing Plant, Terre Haute",$250.00

6-eye labels.

The back cover lists ""Flamenco Sketches"" as the fourth track and ""All Blues"" as the last track, which is incorrect. However, the labels list the tracks in the correct order, which is reflected in the tracklist on this page.

This version can be differentiated from the other 1959 stereo pressings by the labels:
First, there is misprinted version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with an error in the track order on the side B label.
Second, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with ""Kind Of Blue"" printed on one line on the side B label.
Third, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with slightly different typesetting that is most distinguishable in the width of the characters that form the catalog number and ""Stereo Fidelity"" at the top of the labels.

There is also a repress (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with labels that show ""CBS"" (CBS) in the upper center area, but are otherwise very similar to the Columbia '6-eye' labels on this version.

6-eye labels.

The back cover lists ""Flamenco Sketches"" as the fourth track and ""All Blues"" as the last track, which is incorrect. However, the labels list the tracks in the correct order, which is reflected in the tracklist on this page.

This version can be differentiated from the other 1959 stereo pressings by the labels:
First, there is misprinted version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with an error in the track order on the side B label.
Second, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with ""Kind Of Blue"" printed on one line on the side B label.
Third, there is another version (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with slightly different typesetting that is most distinguishable in the width of the characters that form the catalog number and ""Stereo Fidelity"" at the top of the labels.

There is also a repress (Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue) with labels that show ""CBS"" (CBS) in the upper center area, but are otherwise very similar to the Columbia '6-eye' labels on this version.

In 1937, a Negro who still remembered slavery spoke of what it was like in 1865. ""Hallelujah broke out... Everyboby went wild. We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

The original pressing photos are if a second pressing not unlike this but are non the less incorrect. Any pressing of this with a simple (47 West 63rd) is a later pressing. This is a variant that I documented simply because the runout is different. Documenting all of the details will lead to Discogs being a more “complete” catalogue.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

Thelonious Monk And Gerry Mulligan – Mulligan Meets Monk,Riverside Records – RLP 12-247,US,"Vinyl, LP, Album, Mono","Very first pressing of 'Mulligan Meets Monk' - does not yet have the photograph of Monk and Mulligan on the front cover. Also bears no 'Riverside' and/or logo at the bottom right front cover; it does, however, bear the 'Contemporary Series' sign with Riverside and the catalog number mentioned in it at the top right of the front cover. Unlike other 1957 U.S. pressings this one has the red-ink 'ribbon' stamp that reads 'Riverside Spectrosonic High Fidelity Engineering Reeves', placed to the right of the personnel names [see images].

Same release exist with Monk/Mulligan photo on front sleeve : Mulligan Meets Monk

The fact that this version is the first pressing is confirmed by the other titles with their catalog numbers as stated on the back cover in the bottom right corner: ""Monk's other Riverside albums are"" and ""Other outstanding jazz on 12-inch HIGH FIDELITY Riverside LPs includes"" all mention Riverside catalogue numbers between RLP 12-201 and RLP 12-246. Higher numbers had not been released yet and ""Mulligan Meets Monk"" itself is RLP 12-247.

Back covers of other 1957 U.S. pressings have different wording on the bottom right back cover: ""Monk's other Riverside albums include"" and ""Other notable Riverside LPs include"" and now mention catalog numbers much higher than RLP 12-247; all the way up to RLP 12-305, which is ""5 by Monk by 5"", which itself was released in 1959 and could not have been mentioned on a 1957 back cover; confirming that this submission is the actual 1st pressing of this release.

The above can be checked with this release and this release. Both releases have different front covers, now with the photograph of Monk and Mulligan, top left. The first one reads 'Contemporary Series' in upper right hand corner, the other release only has 'Riverside [+ logo]' in lower right hand corner. Most importantly, the catalog numbers on both back covers all show the much higher catalog numbers including ""5 by Monk by 5"" from 1959; in fact also confirming that both versions are reissues from 1959.

Other notable detail is a 'typo' in the matrix/runout etchings: the cat.# etched in the dead wax of the A-side starts with ""RL"" where it must be ""RLP"" [see images and matrix/runout info at identifiers]. Last but not least, both sides have Research Craft's patent numbers in the dead wax: U.S.PAT.# RE 23,946 and G.B. PAT.# 713,418 more information here. On the A-side, the numbers are unreadable, on the B-side they're obvious.

We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

From the liner notes: ""This record was produced during the early part of 1964, when Eric Dolphy and producer Alan Douglas decided to experiment with Eric's original compositions.
Two approaches were agreed upon. One was of clear simplicity; Eric on reed instruments and Richard Davis on bass. The other was more involved - a ten piece orchestra of young men who understood and admired Eric's work.
The recording sessions took place late at night in a very relaxed studio for five successive nights. In this environment the playing of Eric Dolphy, Richard Davis and the other musicians was unbelievably inspired. So much was created, individual compositions went from 'almost commercial' to 'very far out.'
Two albums were produced from that beautiful week. The first, called 'Conversations,' was released through FM Records (now available through the Roulette Record catalogue). On this, the second, is incorporated performances that were considered too futuristic to put out at that time.""",Jazz,1968,Free Jazz,"Rated 5.00 of 2 votes (36 have, 95 want)",Near Mint (NM or M-),Sleeve: Near Mint (NM or M-),100.0%,nan,nan,$159.00

""Ashram means 'hermitage'. Of the many humanly-constructed ashrams and monasteries throughout the world, I feel that the real ashram is in your heart...
...'Turiya' is a state of consciousness. It is regarded as the high state of Nirvana, the goal of human life...
...IHS means 'I Have Suffered'. It exemplifies the sufferings and tribulations of mankind in general. According to Eastern thought, suffering is a gift from God. Certain individuals suffer to a greater extent, more than others, depending upon Karma (action in general). The highest of these individuals are those who sacrifice themselves for humanity and love of God"".",Jazz,1969,Fusion,"Rated 4.49 of 92 votes (626 have, 1191 want)",Very Good (VG),Sleeve: Very Good (VG),100.0%,nan,nan,$147.47

Thelonious Monk And Gerry Mulligan – Mulligan Meets Monk,Riverside Records – RLP 12-247,US,"Vinyl, LP, Album, Mono","Very first pressing of 'Mulligan Meets Monk' - does not yet have the photograph of Monk and Mulligan on the front cover. Also bears no 'Riverside' and/or logo at the bottom right front cover; it does, however, bear the 'Contemporary Series' sign with Riverside and the catalog number mentioned in it at the top right of the front cover. Unlike other 1957 U.S. pressings this one has the red-ink 'ribbon' stamp that reads 'Riverside Spectrosonic High Fidelity Engineering Reeves', placed to the right of the personnel names [see images].

Same release exist with Monk/Mulligan photo on front sleeve : Mulligan Meets Monk

The fact that this version is the first pressing is confirmed by the other titles with their catalog numbers as stated on the back cover in the bottom right corner: ""Monk's other Riverside albums are"" and ""Other outstanding jazz on 12-inch HIGH FIDELITY Riverside LPs includes"" all mention Riverside catalogue numbers between RLP 12-201 and RLP 12-246. Higher numbers had not been released yet and ""Mulligan Meets Monk"" itself is RLP 12-247.

Back covers of other 1957 U.S. pressings have different wording on the bottom right back cover: ""Monk's other Riverside albums include"" and ""Other notable Riverside LPs include"" and now mention catalog numbers much higher than RLP 12-247; all the way up to RLP 12-305, which is ""5 by Monk by 5"", which itself was released in 1959 and could not have been mentioned on a 1957 back cover; confirming that this submission is the actual 1st pressing of this release.

The above can be checked with this release and this release. Both releases have different front covers, now with the photograph of Monk and Mulligan, top left. The first one reads 'Contemporary Series' in upper right hand corner, the other release only has 'Riverside [+ logo]' in lower right hand corner. Most importantly, the catalog numbers on both back covers all show the much higher catalog numbers including ""5 by Monk by 5"" from 1959; in fact also confirming that both versions are reissues from 1959.

Other notable detail is a 'typo' in the matrix/runout etchings: the cat.# etched in the dead wax of the A-side starts with ""RL"" where it must be ""RLP"" [see images and matrix/runout info at identifiers]. Last but not least, both sides have Research Craft's patent numbers in the dead wax: U.S.PAT.# RE 23,946 and G.B. PAT.# 713,418 more information here. On the A-side, the numbers are unreadable, on the B-side they're obvious.

Recorded 28 June, 1965 at Van Gelder Studios, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
This is the 2nd pressing with the 1st take of the piece.
By accident Bob Thiele put out the wrong take. After he went through the initial press run, he switched the masters to the other take and inscribed edition II on the inside of the runout circle. So there are really two versions of ascension.

Edition II solo order

Coltrane solo (3:10–5:48)

Johnson solo (7:45–9:30)

The Paul Desmond Quintet – Desmond,Fantasy – 3-21,US,"Vinyl, LP, 10"", Red","Gatefold cover with interior entry. This album sometimes appears listed as The Paul Desmond Quintet with Voices.

This, Desmond's first album as a leader, was remastered in 1987 and released as one side of a Fantasy LP called Gerry Mulligan/Paul Desmond (OJC 273 / F-8082). Mulligan's side featured Mulligan with Chet Baker and Chico Hamilton.

Here are Paul Desmond's liner notes: (note: liner notes are transcribed exactly as they appear on the original release.)

desmond notes:

my name is paul desmond and here i am 30 years old and this is my first album in which i am not breathing down somebody else's neck which snicker tho you may is in many ways no small accomplishment. it comes, you will notice, in two parts - one with voices, one with a quintet, in each of which are to be found all manner of intriguing things: the fascinating unpredictable musings of dick collins, a light, sparkling and remarkably law-abiding fugue by david van kriedt, lush and lovely choral backgrounds by jack weeks and bill bates, the deft and jovial guitar picking of barney kessel and the occasional forlorn sound of an alto surrounded by microphones, all nudged along gently but firmly by the scratchings and pluckings of respectively, joe dodge and bob bates.
the quintet session came about mostly as a means of recording my two favourite van kreidt compositions, originally called CHORALE PRELUDE and FUGUE IV and identified here as BAROQUE...BUT HAPPY - partly to avoid confusion with earlier fugues by van kreidt but mostly to distinguish them from fugues he is yet to write, because van kreidt writes fugues like some people write post cards. so far this one i think, comes closest to his ideal of a fugue in which the freely swinging, haphazard-sounding phrases of current jazz are woven together in accordance with the ancient, and discouragingly strict, rules of fugue writing.

BAROQUE is a chorale prelude in which the original melody (played by dick collins in a corner) is taken from the bach-riemenschneider collection. against this, the alto and tenor play an interweaving counterpoint, the melody of which is related to the subject of the fugue (BUT HAPPY) which follows.

in the fugue, the subject makes the rounds of trumpet, alto and tenor, is followed by a divertimento based on a fragment of the subject (a particularly charming one in this case, since the subject begins and ends in 3/4, and this development of it amounts to a pocket-size waltz thru which the jazz beat goes ahead on). now comes back the subject in the relative minor, making the rounds in reverse order with the entrances coming closer together, then another divertimento leads into what would ordinarily, in the career of a properly reared fugue, be the pedal - a point at which one tone is sustained by the bass and things happen on top. this being a jazz fugue, the pedal is replaced by short choruses from tenor and alto, after which a series of strettos (periods in which the subject and answer are brought progressively closer and closer together), separated by short divertimentos, lead eventually to the concluding real stretto, which in this case is a heavily emphasized statement of the subject.

JERUVIAN is a fond tribute to gerry mulligan in which you will find a freely and fascinatingly wandering dick collins and some alto (it is my custom when listening to playbacks to cough loudly whenever i hear something coming that i played and don't like and altho things have improved since the early days - ""whispering desmond"" they used to call me, up at sound recorders - most editing sessions still leave me a bit horse. i mention this because there are places on this record where i almost don't have to cough at all).

MISTY WINDOW is a quietly nostalgic ballad which dave wrote in 1946, borrowing the first two bars from an old standard and developing them in different directions (van kreidt develops themes like some people develop pictures).

dave is a charter member of the brubeck octet, also (along with dick collins and jack weeks) of the slightly more select group within the octet, occasionally referred to as the four frenchmen, who studied with darius milhaud at mills college and in paris, in addition to which dave has studied at the college of the pacific and at san francisco state. also, come to think of it, in the army band where i first met him and in which we spent many long hours together cleaning latrines - me, because of a sort of monumental inefficiency, van kreidt mostly because he kept telling the first sergeant how miserable the band sounded. fact was never dave's forte, or for that matter even his mezzo-piano, which may be one reason why his works have not gone forth and multiplied any too much just yet. remember those comic strips they used to run on washington's birthday, where somebody tries to tell the truth all day long and disaster ensues and all? van kreidt, that's the story of his life. with, i rejoice to report (since the uncrafty approach doesn't always get it these days), a pretty groovy outlook as of now. dave lives in tahoe city california with a gorgeous and quiet wife and three beautiful kids, teaches high school and spends his spare time writing music and viewing the surroundings, which are about as idyllic as you can get.

dick collins is a down-home type intellectual with whom (along with van kreidt and jack weeks) i've spent many years in san francisco blowing in one era, so to speak, and out the other. he is to be heard these days mostly with the hard driving trumpet section of woody herman (who notably agreed to do without dick for a night when the band was in reno so dick could fly to hollywood for the session). he has also recorded with a number of small groups for fantasy, as well as (most recently) for victor. and high time, too, because dick is too much.

the side with voices was thought up by jack weeks, who wrote WILL I KNOW and arranged SOON and GARDEN IN THE RAIN. it was produced by bill bates, who wrote WINKY, and brightened considerably by the presence (with the kind permission of contemporary records) of barney kessel. the voices, assembled by bill bates from several of hollywood's most well-fed singing groups, belong to bill thompson, bernie parke, bill brown, sue allen, gloria wood and loulie jean norman, all of them frighteningly competent. (those ethereal sounds up on top of everything else come mostly from loulie jean, the recording angel).

jack weeks, son of anson, has written for countless bands, plays trombone, piano and bass and sings but unfortunately will not travel - except maybe to paris, because he won the prix de paris for composition this year at the university of california, where he is currently working for an m.a.

wonderful barney kessel who put on NEW STRINGS for this occasion and came early so's he could practice his part is definitely a joy to have around and no band should be without him. watching him is almost as much fun as listening to him. - especially his left hand, which always seems to be involved in a sort of prehensile ballet (the last chord of his solo on SOON always reminds me vaguely of an amiable spider moving over to make room for the homeward-bound altophone).

bill bates lives in l.a. with 2 ampexes (ampice?), a wife, several cats and a stuffed owl, is the inventor of the unfortunately seldom-used bates system for swiss bell-ringers, which involves a toy piano equipped with a Ford coil, 12 or so lengths of copper wire and 12 or so stout-hearted bellringers, all assembled in such a fashion that when they hit an E-flat on the piano you hear an e-flat from the appropriate bell-ringer right now and no nonsense about it. his methods with singers altho occasionally less sadistic are wondrously effective and without him we would have been lost.

bass and drums for both sessions were played, with their customary folksy verve, by bob bates and joe dodge.

This is the first Stereo Press per LJC as it has Am-Par labels front and back. This was a very popular album and likely pressed many times on the orange and black ABC Paramount labels.

""The Am-Par label changed to ABC Paramount at A-33. Titles A33 and below on an orange/black ring label with an Am-Par footer is an original first pressing.
