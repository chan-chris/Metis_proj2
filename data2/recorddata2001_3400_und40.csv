From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.
