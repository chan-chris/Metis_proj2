Based on my research this pressing could of come out between 59-62, it contains the Blue Note Sleeve with Baby Face Willette ""Stand and Listen"" which with the label variation would mean it would have to be a 1962 release; however, it also had the plain sleeve used prior to advertising so it could just be a mix up by the previous owner.

Max Roach – We Insist! Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite,Candid – CJM 8002,US,"Vinyl, LP, Album, Mono","""A revolution is unfurling - America's unfinished revolution. It is unfirling in lunch counters, buses, libraries and schools - wherever the dignity and potential of men are denied. Youth and idealism are unfurling. Masses of Negroes are marching onto the stage of history and demanding their freedom now!"" -A Philip Randolph
What this album is saying is that FREEDOM DAY is coming in many places, and those working for it mean to make it stick. In 1937, a Negro who still remembered slavery spoke of what it was like in 1865. ""Hallelujah broke out... Everyboby went wild. We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

What this album is saying is that FREEDOM DAY is coming in many places, and those working for it mean to make it stick. In 1937, a Negro who still remembered slavery spoke of what it was like in 1865. ""Hallelujah broke out... Everyboby went wild. We all felt like heroes, and nobody had make us that way but ourselves."" It's happening again.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

The trio recorded 1 March and the sextet 29 March 1969. Both sessions were held in Herrick Shapel Lounge, Occidental College, Pete Welding and J.W. Hardy recording engineers. Robert McLeod, Artisan Sound Recorders, 1710 N. LaBrea, Hollywood, performed the dub-down from 4-track Scully recordings to the master tapes, and produced the master disc. Artisan features a new generation of recording equipment including the truly revolutionary Neumann VMS-66 lathe with SX-68 cutting head (see I told you it would be technical). The darned thing gives cleaner sound, lower distortion and more of what you want on a 12 inch disc in quality of reproduction than any other rig. It might seem strange to find such engineering quality on such a fly-by-night label ... but relax and enjoy it. Photos by J.W. Hardy, who also conceived of the album.

That the gap is in the labeling of the music rather than the music itself. All music is to be listened to and enjoyed, if possible, and no one should limit himself to just one type of music. If the musician is not limited, the listener should not be limited either.
