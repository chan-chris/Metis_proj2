First US release of this excellent session originally produced in 1961 by Fred Norsworthy for the short-lived Jazz Line label. Unfortunately the label folded before this session’s release.

The LP first saw the light of day in 1966 when it was released as a Freddie Hubbard-led session called Groovy; Fontana put it out in the UK (in mono) and the Netherlands (in stereo).

This version of the session, Dedication!, was promoted by Prestige as a Duke Pearson-led session that was “electronically remastered” for stereo. Dedication! was not released in the US in mono, making the Fontana UK release the only mono version that exists.

The Fontana and Prestige releases have the same seven tracks. but the Fontana tracks appear in a different running order.

The label is identical to The Horace Silver Quintet - Song For My Father (Cantiga Para Meu Pai), but the back cover is different: no address is listed at the bottom, and a logo and small 84185 are printed on the top left and right corners, respectively, in place of the larger serif type for the other version.

Also similar to The Horace Silver Quintet - Song For My Father = Cantiga Para Meu Pai, but that has a smaller pressing ring and a back cover that has 'BLP-4185/84185' in the top right. Presumably, this version was pressed in 68-70, since the mono number from the latter example has been removed.

First US release of this excellent session originally produced in 1961 by Fred Norsworthy for the short-lived Jazz Line label. Unfortunately the label folded before this session’s release.

The LP first saw the light of day in 1966 when it was released as a Freddie Hubbard-led session called Groovy; Fontana put it out in the UK (in mono) and the Netherlands (in stereo).

This version of the session, Dedication!, was promoted by Prestige as a Duke Pearson-led session that was “electronically remastered” for stereo. Dedication! was not released in the US in mono, making the Fontana UK release the only mono version that exists.

The Fontana and Prestige releases have the same seven tracks. but the Fontana tracks appear in a different running order.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.

I consciously went into this recording with an idea in mind that I wanted to show that music is music. That there is not such a big gap between blues and avant-garde. That the gap is in the labeling of the music rather than the music itself. All music is to be listened to and enjoyed, if possible, and no one should limit himself to just one type of music. If the musician is not limited, the listener should not be limited either.

From the back cover: This album is dedicated to all of our many fans in Japan and to all of the Japanese people who were so very kind to us while we were making our concert tour there. It is our wish to return again some day soon. While in Japan, I noticed that the Japanese people were very fond of Latin music, which I also am very fond of. In writing some of these compositions I have attempted to combine Japanese feeling in the melodies with Latin feeling in the rhythms. I hope you enjoy them.
